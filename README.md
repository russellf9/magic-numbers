Magic Numbers
=====

A simple Angular "Magic Numbers" game.

#### Notes

As a starting point for the project I was looking at [Kickstarting Angular With Gulp and Browserify](http://mherman.org/blog/2014/08/14/kickstarting-angular-with-gulp/#.VL5mJL4kK5Y). Although was a good starting of point rather than using Browsify to import Node Modules, I'll stick to the system in the **Schedule App** where I was only minifying when I created the deployment version of the app. For this I'll use the **[gulp-usemin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-usemin)** task.

#### commands

`npm install` - install dependencies

`gulp` - the default task

`gulp build` - build and distribute the app to the `dist` folder
